# Azure Synapse Analytics tutorials

This book contains tutorials that demo how to use serverless Synapse SQL pool to analyze data on Azure Storage. This book contains two tutorials:

- [Analyze COVID ECDC data set](covid-ecdc.ipynb) - In this tutorial, we will perform exploratory data analysis by combining different Azure Open Datasets using serverless SQL and then visualizing the results in Azure Data Studio. In particular, you analyze the New York City (NYC) Taxi dataset. You can learn more about the meaning of the individual columns in the descriptions of the NYC Taxi, Public Holidays, and Weather Data Azure open datasets.
- [Analyze NY Taxi rides](ny-taxi.ipynb) - In this tutorial, you learn how to perform exploratory data analysis by combining different Azure Open Datasets using serverless Synapse SQL pool and then visualizing the results in Azure Synapse Studio.

Open a notebook, select SQL kernel and connect to your Synapse SQL endpoint. Follow the instructions in the tutorials.
