# Azure Synapse Analytics 

This book contains tutorials that demo how to use serverless Synapse SQL pool to analyze data on Azure Storage.

## Prerequisites

To start tutorials, you would need to have Synapse Analytics workspace.

If you don't have one, you can deploy a workspace with underlying Data Lake Storage. Select the **Deploy to Azure** button to deploy the workspave. The template will open in the Azure portal.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F" data-linktype="external">free account</a> before you begin.</p>

The template defines two resources:
- Storage account
- Workspace
